# Details that make interfaces feel better

Great interfaces rarely come from a single thing. It's usually a collection of small details that compound into a great experience. Apply these principles when building or reviewing UI code.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Typography | Text wrapping, font smoothing, tabular numbers |
| Surfaces | Border radius, optical alignment, shadows, image outlines, hit areas |
| Animations | Interruptible animations, enter/exit transitions, icon animations, scale on press |
| Performance | Transition specificity, `will-change` usage |

## Core Principles

### 1. Concentric Border Radius

Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes interfaces feel off.

### 2. Optical Over Geometric Alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need manual adjustment.

### 3. Shadows Over Borders

Layer multiple transparent `box-shadow` values for natural depth. Shadows adapt to any background; solid borders don't.

### 4. Interruptible Animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes — they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

### 5. Split and Stagger Enter Animations

Don't animate a single container. Break content into semantic chunks and stagger each with ~100ms delay.

### 6. Subtle Exit Animations

Use a small fixed `translateY` instead of full height. Exits should be softer than enters.

### 7. Contextual Icon Animations

Animate icons with `opacity`, `scale`, and `blur` instead of toggling visibility. Use exactly these values: scale from `0.25` to `1`, opacity from `0` to `1`, blur from `4px` to `0px`. If the project has `motion` or `framer-motion` in `package.json`, use `transition: { type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }` — bounce must always be `0`. If no motion library is installed, keep both icons in the DOM (one absolute-positioned) and cross-fade with CSS transitions using `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` — this gives both enter and exit animations without any dependency.

### 8. Font Smoothing

Apply `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` to the root layout on macOS for crisper text.

### 9. Tabular Numbers

Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for any dynamically updating numbers to prevent layout shift.

### 10. Text Wrapping

Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings. Use `text-wrap: pretty` for body text to avoid orphans.

### 11. Image Outlines

Add a subtle `1px` outline with low opacity to images for consistent depth. The color must be pure black in light mode (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`) and pure white in dark mode (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`) — never a near-black like slate, zinc, or any tinted neutral. A tinted outline picks up the surface color underneath it and reads as dirt on the image edge.

### 12. Scale on Press

A subtle `scale(0.96)` on click gives buttons tactile feedback. Always use `0.96`. Never use a value smaller than `0.95` — anything below feels exaggerated. Add a `static` prop to disable it when motion would be distracting.

### 13. Skip Animation on Page Load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to prevent enter animations on first render. Verify it doesn't break intentional entrance animations.

### 14. Never Use `transition: all`

Always specify exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

### 15. Use `will-change` Sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, `filter` — properties the GPU can composite. Never use `will-change: all`. Only add when you notice first-frame stutter.

### 16. Minimum Hit Area

Interactive elements need at least 40×40px hit area. Extend with a pseudo-element if the visible element is smaller. Never let hit areas of two elements overlap.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Same border radius on parent and child | Calculate `outerRadius = innerRadius + padding` |
| Icons look off-center | Adjust optically with padding or fix SVG directly |
| Hard borders between sections | Use layered `box-shadow` with transparency |
| Jarring enter/exit animations | Split, stagger, and keep exits subtle |
| Numbers cause layout shift | Apply `tabular-nums` |
| Heavy text on macOS | Apply `antialiased` to root |
| Animation plays on page load | Add `initial={false}` to `AnimatePresence` |
| `transition: all` on elements | Specify exact properties |
| First-frame animation stutter | Add `will-change: transform` (sparingly) |
| Tiny hit areas on small controls | Extend with pseudo-element to 40×40px |

## Review Output Format

Present changes as a markdown table with **Before** and **After** columns. Include every change — not just a subset. Group by principle using a heading above each table. Keep each row focused on a single diff. If a principle was reviewed but nothing needed to change, omit that table.

Example:

#### Concentric border radius

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `rounded-xl` on card + `rounded-xl` on inner button (`p-2`) | `rounded-2xl` on card (`12 + 8`), `rounded-lg` on inner button |

#### Tabular numbers

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `<span>{count}</span>` on animated counter | `<span className="tabular-nums">{count}</span>` |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Nested rounded elements use concentric border radius
- [ ] Icons are optically centered, not just geometrically
- [ ] Shadows used instead of borders where appropriate
- [ ] Enter animations are split and staggered
- [ ] Exit animations are subtle
- [ ] Dynamic numbers use tabular-nums
- [ ] Font smoothing is applied
- [ ] Headings use text-wrap: balance
- [ ] Images have subtle outlines
- [ ] Buttons use scale on press where appropriate
- [ ] AnimatePresence uses `initial={false}` for default-state elements
- [ ] No `transition: all` — only specific properties
- [ ] `will-change` only on transform/opacity/filter, never `all`
- [ ] Interactive elements have at least 40×40px hit area
